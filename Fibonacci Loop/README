The task was to create a programme in C# that could output however many numbers in the Fibonacci sequence that the user has specified.

I had to: 
Research what the Fibonacci loop was.
Make use of loops for both input validation and finding the correct amount of numbers in the sequence.
find a way to calculate and display the numbers in sequence as the programme loops.

In the end it helped me learn a lot about using loops.
