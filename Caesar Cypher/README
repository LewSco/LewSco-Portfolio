The task was to create a programme in C# that could encode and decode Caeser cyphers using text files for encoded and decoded messages.

I had to: 
 - Make the programme read and write from files.
 - Validate the user input, then convert it into a usable shift number using loops.
 - Decypher text by checking which characters were letters and then applying for the shift number before inserting the string into a new variable.

I learned about arrays and Unicode making this a very useful exercise.
